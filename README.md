Here is a summary of key findings from this data set:
60% of those who make more than 50k, and go to the bar more than 4 times per month, accepted the coupon. How about 100k?
Summary: 65% accepted the coupon who visit the bar monthly and make 100k or more a year. How about low wage earners?
68% of those who make <12.5k accepted the coupon. Next, lets's look at bar visits per month vs acceptance
53% of those who never go to the bar, accepted the coupon
62% of those who go to the bar between 1 and 3 times per month accepted the coupon
64% of those who go the bar between 4 and 8 times per month accepted the coupon
People who visit the bar eight times per month, accepted coupons 58% of the time. This is lower than the other groups who visit the bar less. It would be a good follow up question to determine why this group accepts coupons less (assumably they are focused more on drinking than eating, so the type of coupon would be important. Let's next look at people who visit higher end restaurants eight times per month.
People who ate at resturants from 20-50 dollars a meal, accepted the coupon 66% percent of the time. I would assume this group has discretionary income and this is why acceptance is higher (they eat and drink out a lot more than the bar groups). Let's next look at the relationship between income and bar visits.
Summary: In general, alcoholism (visiting a bar greater than 8 times per month) is common across all income groups. Lower to middle class wage earners were more likely to never visit bars than the higher earners. This could be due to more discretionary income, which is certainly another question I'd look into, in future endeavours.
This visualization shows that the women in this group are more likely to go the bar eight times a month, the more educated they are. For men, those who didn't go to college or are in college without a degree were more likely to go to the bar eight times a month.
How does income and occupation affect acceptance of coupons for each group?
Largely, people who make less than $62.5k accept coupons at the higher rates than their peers in higher earning groups. Interestingly, the 100k group accepted coupons much higher than the middle income groups. It would be good to normalize this chart, to make sure we are not underestimating the strength of a smaller group. Let's look closer at the 100k group versus education and occupation.
Of the high earners, computer and math along with business and financial roles, we're more likely to accept coupons in general. Coffee house coupons were accepted at a higher rate than all other coupon types.
Of those that made less than $12.5k accepted coupons, students and unemployed people accepted coupons at a much higher rate than other professions.
For the middle income group, student, unemployed and computer/math professions accepted coupons the most. It would be interesting to look deeper into why these groups are more willing to accept coupons. The most accepted coupons are for low cost restaurants and coffee shops. This would correlate well with a student lifestyle. The bar coupon group was fairly well rounded across the group at this income range, which does make sense: our culture is quite intermixed with alcohol use.
